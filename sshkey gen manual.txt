To connect to GitHub using SSH keys, you need to follow these general steps:
1)Generate SSH Key: If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair on your local machine.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This command will generate a new SSH key using the provided email.

2) Add SSH Key to SSH Agent: Start the SSH agent and add your SSH private key to the SSH agent.
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Replace id_rsa with the name of your private key if it's different.


3) Add SSH Key to GitHub Account: Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Then, go to your GitHub account settings, find the SSH and GPG keys section, and add the SSH key.

4)Test SSH Connection: To test if your SSH connection is successful, run the following command:
ssh -T git@github.com
If successful, you'll see a message like:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
5) Clone a Repository: Now you can clone repositories using SSH. For example:
git clone git@github.com:user/repository.git
Replace user with the GitHub username and repository with the name of the repository you want to clone.
